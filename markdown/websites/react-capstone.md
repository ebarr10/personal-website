### üß† Key Concepts Applied:

- React Components & Props
- State Management (Redux, Context API)
- Middleware: Redux Thunk & Redux Saga
- Event Handling & Conditional Rendering
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- JSX & Virtual DOM
- Client-side Routing with React Router
- Building Reusable and Modular Component Architecture
