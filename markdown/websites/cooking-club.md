# 👩‍🍳 Cooking Club

The **Cooking Club** project was built as a fun and practical way for my coworkers to share food creations around a rotating weekly theme. Users could upload photos and view each other's dishes, encouraging community, creativity, and delicious inspiration.

This project also helped solidify key frontend and backend skills—particularly around deploying a real-world app with thoughtful data handling under Firebase’s free-tier limitations.
