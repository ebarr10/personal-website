# 🧁 Static Recipe Blog

The **Static Recipe Blog** was a foundational experiment in building a fast, content-first site without a backend. This project took a minimalist approach: statically rendered markdown pages served through **Next.js App Router** and deployed on **Netlify**.

It served as the technical and structural prototype for my full personal website, teaching me how to balance content management, site performance, and developer simplicity.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

- ⚛️ Next.js App Router (`/app` directory)
- 📄 Static content using `.md` files
- 🧠 YAML frontmatter with `gray-matter`
- 🖋 Markdown rendering with `markdown-to-jsx`
- 🔁 Dynamic routing via `[slug]/page.tsx`
- 🧼 Lightweight design, no backend
- 🚀 Static deployment on **Netlify**

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **gray-matter** – for parsing frontmatter from `.md` files
- **markdown-to-jsx** – for rendering markdown as React components
- **Netlify** – for static deployment

### 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I became comfortable with:

- Next.js App Router and dynamic route generation
- Using `gray-matter` to extract frontmatter from markdown
- Rendering markdown content safely and flexibly in React
- Designing file-based CMS patterns using just the filesystem
- Deploying static Next.js apps on **Netlify**
- Keeping dev tooling clean in a minimal setup

### 🧾 Source Code & Final Thoughts

You can explore the [source code on GitHub]() to see how the project is structured.

After working with Firebase and real-time data in the [_Cooking Club_](/websites/cooking-club) app, I wanted to explore a totally static approach. The goal: build a markdown-based blog system with clean routing, flexible metadata, and no backend.

The **Static Recipe Blog** was that proving ground for how I wanted to structure and build my personal site going forward. No backend, just clean markdown, solid tooling, and a framework that scales with content.
